# MovieSeriesDiary
Created for a Data Structures and Algorithms course project, which received full credit.

The project includes a comprehensive database of movies and series in firebase, built by web-scraping data from IMDb.

To run the project properly, you must add your own GoogleService-Info.plist from your Firebase console.
